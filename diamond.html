                The Monk Diamond is famous for its distinctive green colour. A Russian nobleman bought the diamond for his wife in 1889, but it was stolen during the Russian Revolution. For the next 30 years, the Monk Diamond’s whereabouts were unknown.In 1947 it was discovered during a police raid on a gang of petty criminals in Moscow. It was returned to the nobleman’s family.

                The nobleman’s son decided the Monk Diamond was unlucky and sold it to the House of Volkov, Moscow’s oldest jewellery house. The House of Volkov paid an undisclosed sum for the jewel, but it was rumoured to be the most expensive diamond sale ever

                The Monk Diamond was on display in the House of Volkov’s private collection until three years ago, when it was stolen in an audacious raid. Despite a long investigation and the promise of a huge reward, the police were
                unable to track down the culprits and the case remains unsolved. The thieves are believed to be the Bond Brothers, the international gang of jewel thieves responsible for numerous high profi le thefts.

                A theory put forward by the explorer Professor Bairstone is that the Monk Diamond
                was smuggled out of Moscow by the Bond Brothers and hidden somewhere in Russia. He thinks “the thieves are
                biding their time until they can sell the diamond on the black market without attracting suspicion.”
