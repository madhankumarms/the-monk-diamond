            Professor Bairstone and Dr Day, along with Ernest the dog, were on an expedition in Siberia when they discovered the Monk Diamond. It had been hidden in a remote mountain cave.

        <p class="main-para shrink">
            The Bond Brothers attempted to sabotage the expedition and reclaim the diamond but were unsuccessful. The team returned to Moscow with the diamond and a special exhibition is being held at the House of Volkov to celebrate their discovery.
